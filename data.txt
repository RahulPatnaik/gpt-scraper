### Introduction to Pokémon

Pokémon, short for "Pocket Monsters," is a media franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori, and is managed by The Pokémon Company, a collaboration between Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. Since its inception in 1996, Pokémon has grown into a global phenomenon, encompassing video games, trading card games, an animated television series, movies, merchandise, and much more.

### Origins and Concept

The concept of Pokémon centers around capturing, training, and battling various creatures known as Pokémon. These creatures inhabit the world alongside humans and come in diverse species, each with unique abilities, appearances, and types. Trainers, the human characters in the Pokémon world, capture Pokémon using devices called Poké Balls. The ultimate goal for many trainers is to become a Pokémon Master by capturing all species of Pokémon and defeating other trainers.

Satoshi Tajiri, the creator, was inspired by his childhood interest in collecting creatures and his love for nature. The idea of Pokémon stemmed from his fascination with collecting insects and his desire to create a game that allowed children to experience the joy of exploration and collection.

### Video Games

The Pokémon video game series is the cornerstone of the franchise. It began with Pokémon Red and Green (Blue in international versions) for the Nintendo Game Boy in 1996. These role-playing games (RPGs) introduced players to the world of Pokémon, allowing them to capture, train, and battle Pokémon. The games were immensely successful, leading to numerous sequels and spin-offs across various gaming consoles.
